    "#### Assessment type\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessments are run as open-book assessments and therefore aim to test synthesis and mastery of knowledge rather than factual recall. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that excessive reliance on sources such as the internet, notes or other sources of factual information will affect the time provided and could therefore prove counterproductive as it may well limit your time to successfully synthesise the answers required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plagiarism\n",
    "\n",
    "This assessement is open book, you can use class notes and online resources. However, this assessment is an **individual assessment** and is subject to standard academic honesty regulations in place at Imperial College London. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the work of another student, past or present, constitutes plagiarism. Giving your work to another student to use may also constitute an offence. Collusion is a form of plagiarism and will be treated in a similar manner. This is an **individual assessment** and thus should be completed solely by you. The College will investigate all instances where an assessment offence is reported or suspected, using plagiarism software, vivas and other tools, and apply appropriate penalties to students.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Submitting your assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Code pushed after the deadline or sent via email/Teams will not be taken into consideration unless there are very good mitigating circumstances. We recommend pushing intermediate solutions of your code often.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The GitHub Classroom link for this assessment is: \n",
    "[`name of http link to the github classroom with the exam`](`actual link to the github classroom`)\n",
    "\n",
    "When satisfied with your anwers, **YOU NEED TO PUSH YOUR ASSESSMENT TO GitHub Classroom!** Solution notebooks not pushed to GitHub classroom before the deadline will not be taken into consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your answers will be 'frozen' by the submission deadline set above. Any modifications applied after that time will not be taken into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can push to GitHub as often you want during the assessment (only the last push before the deadline will be evaluated): so don't leave it to the last minute, feel free to push updates. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ancillary files\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code or answers depend on additional files, such as images, photos, or small data files, then make sure to include these in your submission as well.\n",

    "#### Assessed Coursework Structure and marking criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "This assessment is marked out of a maximum of 100 marks. The total number of achievable point per question is clearly indicated. You need to answer all questions to achieve the maximum mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "In all assessments, we will analyse performance against performance on the rest of the course and against data from previous years and use an evidence-based approach to maintain a fair and robust assessment. As with all assessments, the best strategy is to read the question carefully and answer as fully as possible, taking account of the time and number of marks available. \n",
    "\n",
    "When answering, **keep in mind the 4 main learning objectives of this module**. The assessment aims to measure how well you meet these objectives so your final mark will be benchmarked against these objectives.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Clean code: When presenting code, follow general clean code pracices, e.g. code is well organised and easy to read and understand, avoids repetition of code by creating functions where needed (DRY principle), **code can be executed** top to bottom in the notebook, variable names are logical, required libraries specified. \n",
